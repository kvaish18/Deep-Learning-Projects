# Dog-vs-Cat
Cats vs Dogs classification is a fundamental Deep Learning project for beginners. If you want to start your Deep Learning Journey with Python Keras, you must work on this elementary project.

### Objective
In this Keras project, we will discover how to build and train a convolution neural network for classifying images of Cats and Dogs.

### The Asirra (Dogs VS Cats) dataset:
The Asirra (animal species image recognition for restricting access) dataset was introduced in 2013 for a machine learning competition. The dataset includes 25,000 images with equal numbers of labels for cats and dogs.
